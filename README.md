# JS-Lesson-4-Pot-Luck-Party
Created with CodeSandbox
This project's purpose was to fix some minor problems connecting the Javascript file to the HTML file. In addition to make some minor adjustments in showing the images that were in the HTML file as well as the Javascript file. This was a fun little exercise to do. This required also some debugging which was done in correcting the minor errors.
